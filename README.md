# open-dudu-cook-book

An electron-vue project that clones an abandonware called DuduCookBook.

## What is DuduCookBook

[Dudusoft](http://www.dudusoft.com/)(嘟嘟軟件, [Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20090417062143/http://www.dudusoft.com/)) was an software company that developed a cookbook software called DuduCookBook(嘟嘟美食菜谱).

One day, I found DuduCookBook in my computer, and later found that it's website has been closed almost ten years. But there's an interesting thing for me: The software's recipe is rendered by HTML. Also, I dumped some XML files from it. Then I thaught: "How about render and modify them by morden technology?"

So... Here it is.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
